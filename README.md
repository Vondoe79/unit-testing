# unit-testing

A brief introduction to unit testing in python using PyCharm.

This intro is based on a couple of online tutorials and use of this approach in my projects.

A multi-level module importation within a project directory is also featured here for those needing an intro into the
subject. This also reflects my personal struggle with this matter when I started as a data scientist.
